 * Refines {@link Declaration}s.

 * UrlFunctionValue} and {@link KeywordValue}. These more specific parts will not be delivered to subscription methods until the
 * parent {@link Declaration} is first refined. See the main readme file for more information on refinement.

 * In custom refiner plugins, you can reuse the logic from this class to parse declarations with the {@link
 * #delegateRefinement(Declaration, Grammar, Broadcaster)} method. For example, to check if the raw declaration content contains a
 * certain string and if so to refine it.
