/**
 * An example of using the sample custom declaration (and at-rule!) classes in this package.
 * <p>
 * This feature mimics the "mixin" functionality common in CSS preprocessors. Mixins are defined in the CSS source using at-rule
 * grammar. Subsequent rules can utilize a custom declaration syntax that includes the mixin into the rule, optionally with
 * parameters. By including the mixin, the mixin's template declarations are copied into the rule.
 * <p>
 * <b>CAVEAT:</b> custom declarations are at the edge of what's currently supported. These example classes aren't pristine, but it
 * should at least give an idea of what things are currently possible.
 * <p>
 * We give the parser an instance of the {@link MixinPlugin}. This plugin is a {@link GrammarPlugin} that registers our {@link
 * MixinRefiner}. The refiner handles actually parsing the custom mixin at-rules as well as the custom declaration mixin
 * references. The nature of our new syntax also necessitates creating a custom {@link MixinTokenFactory}, which we use to allow
 * declarations to begin with our special {@code +} symbol.
