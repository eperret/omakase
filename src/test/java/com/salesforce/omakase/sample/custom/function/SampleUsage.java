/**
 * An example of using the sample custom function classes in this package.
 * <p>
 * The custom function represents a variable lookup, using the format <code>custom-var(varName)</code>.
 * <p>
 * We give the parser an instance of the {@link CustomVarPlugin}. This plugin handles parsing the custom function, and creates
 * {@link CustomVarFunction} AST objects. Because we make the AST object {@link Subscribable}, it can be subscribed to like any
 * other standard AST objects, which our {@link CustomVarCounter} plugin demonstrates.
 * <p>
 * This sample usage parses a CSS source twice. The first time we just count the number of times the custom function is used, but
 * we don't resolve anything. The second time we resolve and replace the custom function with the substituted values.
 * <p>
 * Things to try:
 * <p>
 * <b>1)</b> Change the variable values. <b>2)</b> Have the sample CSS reference an invalid variable. <b>3)</b> Have a variable
 * value result in invalid CSS (e.g., making primary-color too many chars). <b>4)</b> Write another custom plugin that validates
 * Terms, and see how it validates the substituted variable values as well, etc...
