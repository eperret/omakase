/**
 * An example of using the sample custom selector classes in this package.
 * <p>
 * This feature mimics the "placeholder" selector functionality common in CSS preprocessors. Placeholder selectors are written
 * with a special syntax using the format <code>%name</code>. The placeholder has a rule and declarations as normal, however the
 * placeholder is not written out by default.
 * <p>
 * Subsequent selectors can "extend" the placeholder. By extending, the placeholder will include that selector in the output.
 * Essentially this is a way of being DRY. Run the example to make this description clearer.
 * <p>
 * We give the parser an instance of the {@link PlaceholderSelectorPlugin}. This plugin is a {@link GrammarPlugin} that registers
 * our {@link PlaceholderTokenFactory}. This plugin also handles parsing the custom selectors, and creates {@link
 * PlaceholderSelector} AST objects. The nature of our new syntax also necessitates creating a custom {@link
 * PlaceholderTokenFactory}, which we use to allow selectors to begin with our special {@code %} symbol.
 * <p>
 * Things to try:
 * <p>
 * <b>1)</b> Add more placeholders and CSS to utilize it. <b>2)</b> Try adding or making the existing placeholder unused <b>3)</b>
 * Try referencing an invalid placeholder name. <b>4)</b> Try changing <code>.primary</code> to something more complex like
 * <code>.primary > .btn </code>
